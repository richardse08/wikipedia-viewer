# Things I could have done differently

I could definitely have done a few things differently for this project, specifically instead of using <br> I could have leveraged CSS to create divs for the results that would only show when the enter icon is clicked

Consider using media queries to create a better mobile experience

Re-style the buttons and add wikipedia logo
